A script mod for STALKER Anomaly (Open X-Ray) to hot-patch names and descriptions of items before presentation. Hooks into the game's item UI script to parse, format, and reprocess names and descriptions.

## Features

Item names are capitalized following the rules of the APA style guide.

Item descriptions are reformatted to be more consistent in their use of capitalization, sectioning, spacing, and colors.
